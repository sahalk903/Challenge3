# Challenge 3

This project uses a Java swing GUI for a user to be able to add, commit, and push more efficiently than using a terminal. The user needs to input their GitHub username and access token, the class path for the repo, the bracnh being merged to, and a commit message. Once all this is done they can simply press push to add, commit, and push all their changes! More information on this project can be found on this project's GitHub pages below.
