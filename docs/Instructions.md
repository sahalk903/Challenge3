# Instructions

1. Under configure, select add token.
2. Enter your Github username and access token and then press enter (Don't close this window or you will lose your client).
3. On the main GUI, enter the class path for the local repo, the branch you want to merge into, and the commit message.
4. Press the push button.

All changes will be added, committed, and pushed to the remote repo automatically. A confirmation window will pop up and the user can return to the min GUI.

Note: For convenience, after this process the branch and path stay in the GUI, but the commit message is reset.
